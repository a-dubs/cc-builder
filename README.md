# not-cloud-init

A tool for gathering information about a currently running machine and generating a basic cloud-config that can be used as a good starting point for re-creating the original machine via cloud-init.  
Since this tool only generates a cloud-config file for cloud-init to use, this tool is inherently limited by cloud-init capabilities.

## Current State: _work in progress_ (Alpha 1.0)

I am looking to test out the reliability and robustness of the tool in its current state.

## What does it do?

This tool gathers information from your system then generates two cloud config files: 
- one with apt packages from aptmark showmanual
- one with apt packages from custom apt history parsing

## Gathering feedback

If you have a few minutes to kill, please consider running this tool locally on your system or machine(s) of your
choosing. 

1. Download the not-cloud-init.py script using wget or curl:  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-dubs/not-cloud-init/main/not-cloud-init.py`  
or  
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-dubs/not-cloud-init/main/not-cloud-init.py -o not-cloud-init.py`

2. Run the not-cloud-init python script:  
`python3 not-cloud-init.py`

3. Look over the content of the generated cloud-config files and then fill out this google form with your feedback
and optionally include the generated cloud-config files in the form as well if you are comfortable with doing so.
https://forms.gle/XjBJbqFtaG1svf1S8  

If you end up testing on multiple machines, you can just fill out the form multiple times and just skip to the second
page of the form to submit the cloud-config files.
